Yet another git-remote-hg
=========================

[The way git remote helpers work forces how to call them]

BEWARE /!\ This is a prototype. Implementation details may change,
which would affect commit SHA1s.

When you update, please read this file again, it likely will contain
important notes.

Setup:
------

Install mercurial.
Add this directory to your PATH.

Usage:
------

$ git clone hg::<mercurial repo>

where <mercurial repo> can be a path to a local directory containing a
mercurial repository, or a http, https or ssh url.

Essentially, use git like you would for a git repository, but use a
hg:: url where you would use a git:// url.

Limitations:
------------

At the moment, push is not supported.

There is no support for the following mercurial features:
- obsolescence markers
- bookmarks
- branches
- phases
